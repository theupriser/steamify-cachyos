# Changelog

All notable changes, per version and per commit. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); the current one is `VERSION` in
`steamify.sh`. Versions before 0.7.0 were numbered afterwards,
one per merged pull request.

## 2.7.0 - 2026-09-28

- `4f6e6fd` **feat: --defaults takes --skip <ids> and --boot gamescope|desktop, for the Steam Machine ISO's installer pages**
- `5bf9da4` **fix: HDMI-CEC enables cec-audio-control.socket (the TV remote's volume keys); existing installs get it as an update**
- `14aa7c0` **fix: the app's progress screen says "Boot into desktop", not "Boot into Boot into"**
- `c4ec755` **feat: --defaults --options <ids> (exactly these on) replaces --skip; steamify.sh --boot gamescope|desktop on its own switches where an installed conversion starts**
- `eadbdda` **docs: release branches (release/X.Y.Z, feature/ and bugfix/ branches into it, the release into main); CI builds release/** pushes**
- `bee18b7` **docs: the agent merges feature/bugfix branches into the release branch; the release into main stays the user's**
- `501c0ba` **docs: gh or git for merging into the release branch**
- **docs: gh is required for the release-branch pull requests; ask the user to install it**

## 2.6.0 - 2026-09-27

- `b948c20` **feat: --defaults applies the default setup without the menu, also from an installer (no session): the base for a Steam Machine ISO**

## 2.5.2 - 2026-09-27

- `0c96bed` **docs: README screenshot at 2.5.2: everything on, nothing to update**

## 2.5.1 - 2026-09-27

- **fix: Add as non-Steam game asks Steam to close again every 15 s (a Steam that was still starting ignored it)**
- `3a0692f` **docs: README screenshot at 2.5.1 with Add as non-Steam game**
- `e86ddcc` **feat: Add as non-Steam game: Steamify in the Steam library, under the shortcut; controller works when started from Steam**
- `389bc33` **fix(ui): B never quits (Steam sends Esc for it), Ctrl+Q does; started from Steam, the hints show the Steam Controller's buttons**
- `c6c1150` **fix(ui): Enter selects (a Steam Controller's A in Steam's desktop layout); Ctrl+Enter reviews and applies**
- `98e2eff` **fix(ui): Started from Steam, the app runs without Steam's overlay (Qt aborted) and stays in the foreground, so Steam Input gives it the controller**
- `431515b` **feat(ui): Review & apply greyed out while nothing would change; the Done screen shows why a run stopped**

## 2.5.0 - 2026-09-27

- **docs: README: what the VRAM booster says with NVIDIA's closed driver; shorter unsupported text in the app**
- `32c33e4` **fix: An option left unticked stays off: it came back ticked as "new" on the next run (since 2.3.0)**
- `2dd0f3a` **feat: VRAM booster with NVIDIA says what to do: update, switch to the open driver (chwd command), or not supported by the card**
- `57995bc` **docs: VRAM booster works with NVIDIA's open kernel modules (driver 615+); only the closed driver is greyed out**
- `d57e8d8` **docs: AGENTS.md and changelog for the vidmem detection**
- `5a34633` **feat: VRAM booster also for drivers that name their region vidmem (or numbered), NVIDIA included once its driver registers it**
- `479b70b` **feat: Everything in the home folder under steamify (state, scripts, icon), moved once from the old name**
- `2e0881b` **fix: fill takes values literally; the notifier path is quoted in its unit**

- `572417b` **fix: Open Steamify from the notification starts the app (own scope), the same way it was last used (app or terminal)**
- `cf73229` **feat: Update notifications: a notification and tray icon when there's a new Steamify**

## 2.4.1 - 2026-09-27

- **chore: Version 2.4.1**
- `6f598d1` **docs: README screenshot shows every option**
- `9bbe5fa` **docs: Screenshot of the app's menu in the README**

## 2.4.0 - 2026-09-27

- `03a8b8c` **chore: Version 2.4.0**
- `e699a3f` **refactor(ui): One QML file per screen; the HDMI boost's setup screens and backend commands removed**

## 2.3.0 - 2026-09-27

- `86b9744` **feat: VRAM booster greyed out with an NVIDIA card, with why**
- `b0947d7` **feat: VRAM booster only for GPUs with at least 2 GB of their own VRAM**
- `3f97c85` **feat: VRAM booster for every supported GPU, not only the Steam Machine**
- `fd162c1` **feat: New badge for default sub-options added in this version**
- `54ebddf` **feat: VRAM booster for the Steam Machine**

## 2.2.0 - 2026-09-27

- `ef585c0` **docs: Changelog entries per commit for 2.2.0**
- `32795bd` **feat(ui): Update badge on the progress screen**
- `3c8ca65` **fix(ui): Never write the sudo password to a file; Update label on the progress screen**
  - The app gave `sudo` the password through a short-lived file; the helper
    now reads it from a named pipe the app feeds from memory each time sudo
    asks. The progress screen showed "undefined" for an update.
- `11a91ef` **feat: Update badge on components that get a newer version**
  - The menu (terminal and app) shows "(update)" / an Update badge after
    the name of a component a normal run will update.
- `163f790` **feat: Feature versions are Steamify versions; Steam Machine support is 2.2.0**
  - Each component records the Steamify version of what it set up; when a
    release changes a component, installs with an older version are ticked
    and updated by a normal run ("update" in the plan and the app's
    review). A setup from before counts as 2.1.0, so Steam Machine support
    (2.2.0) is updated on machines set up with 2.1.0. New default
    sub-options (like the power-off fix) are ticked where their parent is on.
- `e121b06` **fix: Remove whatever is left of HDMI refresh boost, pin or no pin**
  - HDMI refresh boost needed the pinned kernel and is retired (newer
    kernels do HDMI 2.1 themselves): whatever is left of it (saved
    displays, also ones not connected, its hotplug script, the old kernel
    parameter) is unticked and removed by the next run.
- `19ca966` **docs: Drop the kernel pin and HDMI refresh boost descriptions**
- `56fb908` **docs: Power-off fix texts cover every affected kernel, not just 7.2**
- `6df19eb` **feat: Power-off fix as its own sub-option, drop the kernel pin, feature versions**
  - The power-off fix is a sub-option of Steam Machine support, ticked
    along with it (opt-out). The kernel pin is no longer offered: an
    existing pin is shown unticked, so the next run removes it and brings
    back CachyOS's current kernel.
- `7694c97` **feat: Power-off fix for the Steam Machine; the kernel pin is optional**
  - With recent kernels (newer 6.x, 7.0 and 7.1 updates, 7.2 and probably
    later ones) the Steam Machine started again right after shutting down:
    they keep the wake bit the firmware sets on GPIO pin 18, which Valve's
    own kernel clears in a patch that won't reach CachyOS. A small module,
    built with DKMS for each installed kernel, clears it right before
    power-off. Tested with CachyOS 7.2.8: stays off, and without the module
    it rebooted.
  - Module sources and patches live in `patches/` instead of inside the
    shell code; the single-file build and the app package include them. The
    Steam Machine CEC driver change is now
    `patches/cros-ec-cec-single-port.patch`.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-09-26

- **feat(ui): Manage button for HDMI refresh boost**
  - The item's switch is a button: Set up… while no display is saved,
    Manage after that. Manage lists the saved displays (connected or not),
    removes one with its Remove button, and sets up the connected display
    when it has no saved rates yet.
- **4cc87aa feat: HDMI refresh boost per display, with a Saved displays screen**
- **36d0a9d feat: HDMI refresh boost only for the display it was set up for**
  - The EDID override was on the kernel command line, so any display on that
    HDMI port got the first display's timings. Rates are now saved per
    display and loaded at boot and at every hotplug for the display that's
    connected (its ID read over DDC); a display without saved rates, or
    unplugging, puts the port back on the display's own EDID. No initramfs
    or boot loader change any more. An existing setup is moved over when
    re-applied (`a`).
  - The item shows on only while the connected display is boosted, so a new
    display can be set up by ticking it; unticking removes only that one.

## 2.0.3 - 2026-09-26

- **fix: HDMI-CEC on the Steam Machine**
  - Mainline's `cros_ec_cec` driver doesn't know the Steam Machine, so there
    was no `/dev/cec0`. HDMI-CEC now builds Valve's version of the driver
    with DKMS (`steamify-cros-ec-cec`) for every installed kernel, with a fix
    so it finds amdgpu's HDMI port even though amdgpu loads first. An
    existing HDMI-CEC install is ticked in the menu to add it.

## 2.0.2 - 2026-09-26

- **badfd84 docs: Non-affiliation disclaimer in the README**
  - States that the project isn't affiliated with Valve or CachyOS, and that
    Steam and SteamOS are Valve's trademarks.

## 2.0.1 - 2026-09-25

- **2b3f1de feat: The Steamify shortcut opens the app**
  - "Steamify CachyOS" on the desktop and in the launcher starts the newest
    app (in Konsole the first time, if PySide6 still has to be installed).
    The terminal menu is "Steamify Terminal" in the launcher. A shortcut from
    before 2.0.1 is ticked in the menu, so a normal run replaces it.
  - steamify-app.sh leaves the shortcut's launcher entry alone (it has the
    same id, `steamify-ui.desktop`, and always starts the newest release).

## 2.0.0 - 2026-09-25

- **feat: Steamify app (v2 UI)**
  - A graphical app for controller, keyboard and TV remote, driving the same
    components through `steamify.sh --backend`; the BIOS update with both
    warnings; built by GitHub and run with curl.
- **feat(ui): HDMI refresh boost in the app**
  - "Set up…" opens its own screen: the display, its resolution and the
    rates on offer (its own mode, calculated tens, the HDMI 2.0 limit). The
    display's own faster mode is switched to right away; every other rate
    has a Try button (switch live, wait for the picture, then keep it within
    15 s or it switches back) and a tick box. Install installs the ticked
    rates. All rates are loaded when the screen opens, so a try is only a
    mode switch.
  - Unticking Steam Machine support or the kernel pin unticks it, as in the
    menu.
- **fix(ui): The details panel scrolls instead of overflowing**
- **fix: Switching back to a rate like 59.97 Hz**
  - `hdmi_set_mode` compared it as a whole number and printed an error.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-09-25

- **feat: HDMI refresh boost (Steam Machine, pinned kernel)**
  - The pinned 7.1.6 kernel doesn't read the extra EDID block where monitors
    list their fast modes, and does no HDMI 2.1, so HDMI displays often stay
    at 60 Hz. The new menu item reads the display's EDID over DDC,
    calculates the highest rate that fits HDMI 2.0 at the desktop resolution
    (rounded down to ten, plus the hundred below as a safe option), tests
    each step live with a confirmation, and makes the confirmed ones
    permanent through `drm.edid_firmware` (Limine, sdboot-manage or GRUB).
- **feat: HDMI refresh boost and Update BIOS under Steam Machine support**
  - Both are sub-options now, shown only while Steam Machine support is
    ticked. Unticking it unticks them; unticking the kernel pin unticks the
    HDMI refresh boost.

## 1.1.4 - 2026-09-25

- **fix: No lock screen in single user mode before a restart**
  - The screen locker only read the new settings at the next login, so the
    PC still locked after 5 minutes idle until then. Turning single user
    mode on or off now tells it to reload them right away.

## 1.1.3 - 2026-09-25

- **fix: HDMI-CEC settings shown in Steam**
  - CachyOS's gaming mode script sets `STEAM_ENABLE_CEC=0`, which hides
    Steam's HDMI-CEC settings (and its CEC volume buttons). HDMI-CEC now adds
    a drop-in for `steam-launcher.service` that overrides it with
    `STEAM_ENABLE_CEC=1` (`/etc/steamify/steam-cec.env`).
  - HDMI-CEC set up by 1.1.0-1.1.2 shows as off and ticked, so a normal run
    (Enter) adds this.

## 1.1.2 - 2026-09-25

- **fix: Steam's HDMI-CEC settings reach cecd on a first run**
  - HDMI-CEC runs before Steam Machine support, which installs
    steamos-manager; so steamos-manager's `configure-cecd` unit couldn't be
    enabled and cecd ran without Steam's settings. Steam Machine support now
    links them once steamos-manager is there.

## 1.1.1 - 2026-09-25

- **perf: Pinned kernel before the LED driver**
  - With the kernel pin ticked, Steam Machine support installs kernel
    7.1.6-1 first, so DKMS builds the LED driver once, for that kernel,
    instead of for the current kernel first and then again. The LED driver
    then loads after the restart, which it now says instead of warning.
- **fix: steamos-manager starts after cecd**
  - It checks only at its start whether cecd runs; if it was first, Steam's
    HDMI-CEC settings were missing until it restarted. A drop-in
    (`/etc/systemd/user/steamos-manager.service.d/`) orders it after cecd.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-09-25

- **feat: HDMI-CEC** (experimental, on every PC; ticked by default only on a
  Steam Machine)
  - Valve's `cecd`, `cec-audio-control` and `inputattach-cec-units` from its
    SteamOS repository (SHA-256 checked): use Steam with the TV remote, and
    the TV turns on and off with the PC. On a Steam Machine, steamos-manager
    configures it from Steam's settings.
  - Works with any `/dev/cec*` (GPU or USB adapter); the menu lists them.
  - `CEC.md`: which PCs have CEC (NVIDIA doesn't, AMD/Intel only over some
    DisplayPort adapters), and USB adapters for your own build.
  - Restarts steamos-manager, which only offers Steam its HDMI-CEC settings
    when cecd was there at its start.
  - The README no longer says Steam Machine support alone gives HDMI-CEC:
    `cecd` wasn't installed, so it didn't.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-25

- **feat: Pin the kernel to 7.1.6-1 on a Steam Machine**
  - New sub-option under Steam Machine support, ticked along with it (opt
    out): newer CachyOS kernels make the Steam Machine reboot instead of
    shutting down. Installs `linux-cachyos` and `-headers` 7.1.6-1 and adds
    them to `IgnorePkg`; unticking removes the pin and updates the system.
  - The packages are kept in `/var/cache/steamify/kernel` and reinstalled
    from there without downloading; else from pacman's cache, the CachyOS
    archive, the CachyOS mirror, or `PINNED_KERNEL_URL`.
  - First download source: the `kernel-7.1.6-1` release of this repo, a
    one-off release that always has these files.
  - Every file is checked against its SHA-256 (in the script) and its
    CachyOS signature before it's installed; a bad file is deleted.
  - Installed kernel headers are no longer updated by the wizard, so the
    pinned kernel keeps matching headers.
  - The BIOS item moves down one (9 on a Steam Machine).
- **docs: Shorter README, with a Steam Machine section**
  - How it works moved to `TECHNICAL.md`, problems to `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`;
    the README links to them and to the files it mentions.
- **feat: No more KDE wallet password prompts in single user mode**
  - Uses Valve's empty, password-less wallet, like SteamOS; apps such as
    Brave no longer ask for the wallet password after autologin.
  - Your own wallet is moved to `kdewallet.kwl.bak-steamify` and comes back,
    unchanged, when single user mode is off; the single user wallet is kept
    and reused next time.
  - Moved from the SteamOS theme, where it only helped without any wallet.
- **fix: No second sudo password prompt while installing yay**
  - `makepkg -si` installs with `sudo -k`, which forgets the cached password;
    yay is now built with makepkg and installed with `sudo pacman -U`.
- **docs: LICENSE.md** with the MIT license the README already named.
- **chore: No more `setup-gamescope-boot.sh` release asset**
  - Only `steamify.sh` is published; the old name from before 0.9.0 is gone.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-09-24

- `0f503dd` **feat: Boot into gamescope or the desktop**
  - New menu row under the conversion, "Boot into: [gamescope] / desktop";
    gamescope stays the default and is never changed on a first run.
  - Desktop: `steamify-boot-desktop.service` sets the autologin session to
    Plasma at every boot, before the login manager starts; Return to Gaming
    Mode and Steam's Switch to Desktop keep working. Back to gamescope removes
    it. Choosing desktop turns the conversion on; turning the conversion off
    resets it to gamescope.
  - The later menu items move down one (BIOS is now 8 on a Steam Machine).
- `4895de3` **feat: "Boot into" is a sub-option of the conversion**
  - Shown indented under the SteamOS conversion, and only while it's ticked.
- `bd90e29` **feat: Left/Right arrows choose on the "Boot into" row**
  - Left = gamescope, right = desktop (Space still switches); the row says
    "←/→ choose" and the key help lists Left/Right.
- **fix: Messages say which way it boots**
  - "This will: boot into: gamescope (from the next boot)" instead of "turn
    off: Boot into the desktop instead of gaming mode", and the same in the
    progress line and the "Done" overview.

## 0.9.1 - 2026-09-24 (#10)

- `2e107e5` **fix: LED driver for every kernel on a fresh install**
  - The DKMS override was written to `/etc/dkms` before `dkms` was installed,
    when that folder doesn't exist yet, so it silently failed and the build
    for other kernels (e.g. LTS) failed as in 0.6. The folder is created first
    now, and a failed write stops with an error.
- `5ab83d6` **feat: Restart question on quit is "Restart now? [Y/n]"**
  - When something needs a restart, `q` asks with yes as the default; `n` goes
    back to the menu and the next `q` asks again. Ctrl+C quits without
    restarting; scripted input that runs out never restarts.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-09-24 (#9)

The wizard is now called **Steamify CachyOS**, and can put a shortcut to
itself on the desktop.

- `f01aa93` **feat: Wizard shortcut on the desktop and in the launcher**
  - New menu item: a desktop icon and app launcher entry
    that open the newest release of the wizard in Konsole (`curl | bash`).
  - Its icon: Valve's Return to Gaming Mode icon with a gear instead of the
    arrow (`assets/steam-gaming-settings.svg`), published with every release
    and downloaded from there.
  - Desktop files are written already executable, so Plasma runs them instead
    of opening them in an editor.
- `be874b8` **feat: Rename to Steamify CachyOS**
  - Menu header, the shortcut ("Steamify CachyOS", menu item "Steamify
    shortcut"), release titles, README and AGENTS.md.
- `1c34a97` **chore: Repository renamed to steamify-cachyos**
  - All URLs point to `github.com/theupriser/steamify-cachyos` (the old ones
    redirect). The script keeps its name, `setup-gamescope-boot.sh`, so the
    old download URL keeps working; internal names such as
    `~/.local/state/cachyos-gamescope-boot` stay, so existing installs can
    still be turned off.
- `69a420b` **feat: The script is now steamify.sh**
  - `setup-gamescope-boot.sh` is renamed to `steamify.sh`; releases publish the
    bundle under both names, so `.../download/setup-gamescope-boot.sh` keeps
    working. The Steamify shortcut runs `steamify.sh`.
- `b0553ae` **docs: Shorter README intro**
- `afc05b0` **feat: The shortcut's window closes itself after a countdown**
  - After the wizard ends, a 10-second countdown closes the Konsole window
    (Enter closes it right away); after an error it stays open until Enter.
  - A failed download now counts as an error (`pipefail`) instead of running
    an empty script.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-09-24 (#8)

An opt-in BIOS update for the Steam Machine, and a menu that comes back after
every run.

- `2f9b2a5` **feat: Opt-in BIOS update for the Steam Machine**
  - New menu item (Steam Machine only, never ticked by default) showing the
    current BIOS version and the newest from Valve's `fremont-hw-support`.
  - Two large warnings and two confirmations (y/N, then typing `UPDATE`),
    checksum-verified download, installed with fwupd; the wizard then offers
    the restart that writes it, with a warning to keep the power on.
- `40c9ee6` **fix: BIOS update only when newer, device check first, aligned warnings**
  - The item is greyed out and can't be ticked unless Valve has a newer BIOS.
  - Before any warning: SHA-256 of Valve's package, then fwupd confirms the
    firmware fits this machine's hardware; otherwise it stops.
  - Warning box drawn with a solid red frame whose edges line up, and the
    menu's "Now" column aligned.
- `b70c9d6` **fix: shellcheck in the bundle, and the docs for the BIOS checks**
  - A variable name in `lib/bios.sh` clashed with `lib/state.sh` in the bundle
    (CI's shellcheck would fail); README, AGENTS.md and this changelog updated.
- `54fc9e3` **feat: Menu comes back after each run, BIOS dry run, version 0.8.0**
  - After a run the menu returns with the new state; quit with `q`. When
    something needs a restart, choose between back to the menu (`m`) and
    restart now (`r`); quitting asks once more.
  - A staged BIOS update greys the item out until the restart.
  - `WIZARD_BIOS_DRY_RUN=1` walks through the whole BIOS update (download,
    checksum, both warnings) but only prints the install and never flashes.
  - README: the menu loop and the BIOS update step by step.
- `45a8757` **fix: BIOS dry run also walks through the restart choices**
  - A dry run counts as staged, so `[m]`/`[r]` and the restart question on `q`
    show up; in dry-run mode restarting only prints what it would do.
- `429e840` **fix: Shorter BIOS labels so the menu fits 80 columns**
  - "now F7F0107, newest F7F0108 (own risk)", "F7F0108 waits for a restart",
    "F7F0107 is up to date"; shorter dry-run line.
- `99a95ab` **fix: Kernel legend only mentions the LEDs on a Steam Machine**
- `c0014ee` **docs: Last commit hash in the changelog; 0.7.0 was released on its own (#6, #7)**

## 0.7.0 - 2026-09-24 (#6, #7)

The SteamOS theme comes from CachyOS's `cachyos-vapor` package, applied with
Vapor's own desktop layout, and gains the SteamOS desktop extras. The Steam
Machine LED driver works on every installed kernel and survives kernel updates.

- `978f5a1` **feat: SteamOS theme from cachyos-vapor with its desktop layout, plus SteamOS desktop extras**
  - Installs `cachyos-vapor` instead of extracting Valve's `steamdeck-kde-presets`
    into `~/.local/share`; removes it on disable if the wizard installed it.
  - Applies the Vapor global theme with "Desktop and window layout": Steam Deck
    wallpaper, SteamOS panel and launcher icon. Layout files are backed up and
    restored; every key from Vapor's defaults goes through the undo journal.
  - Restores the real previous color scheme on disable (CachyOS's BreezeDark
    colors have no scheme name), instead of falling back to light Breeze.
  - Registers Vapor as the dark theme, so Plasma's Dark Mode toggle shows on.
  - Drops the extra SteamOS desktop defaults (GTK, Konsole, gsettings, panel tweaks).
  - New SteamOS desktop extras, downloaded from Valve's newest
    `steamdeck-kde-presets` (checksum verified) into `/usr/local`: Add to Steam,
    Nested Desktop, the SteamOS Return to Gaming Mode icon, the Steam Keyboard
    window rule and an empty KWallet (only when there is no wallet yet).
  - Single user mode's launcher settings are re-applied after the layout reset.
- `7802d90` **fix: LED driver for every kernel, kernel headers at boot, console power button, kernel overview**
  - DKMS override (`/etc/dkms/leds-valve-dkms.conf`) so the LED driver builds
    for every installed kernel (the LTS kernel failed) and on kernel updates.
  - `ensure-kernel-headers.service` installs missing kernel headers at boot, so
    a newly added kernel gets the LED driver too.
  - Power button sleeps and no automatic suspend on mains power (Steam Machine).
  - Menu shows every kernel with its headers, Steam controller driver and LED
    driver, plus whether the LEDs are loaded.
  - The selected menu row is highlighted in full.
- `10b5164` **docs: Version 0.7.0 and CHANGELOG**
  - `VERSION` in the entry point, shown in the menu header and the bundle.
  - README and AGENTS.md updated for the theme, the extras and the LED driver.
- `eb3169e` **ci: Version and changelog in the release notes**
  - The `latest` release's title shows the version, and its notes include this
    version's section of `CHANGELOG.md`.
  - Fix a shellcheck warning in the bundle (a variable name shared with
    `lib/state.sh`), which would have failed the CI check.
- `d7231eb` **chore: Move the bundle tool to .github/tools/bundle.sh**
- `5c00504` **docs: Commit hashes in the changelog**
- `8aab946` **ci: A release per version (tag v0.7.0, ...) instead of overwriting "latest"**
  - Each push to `main` publishes release `v$VERSION` with that version's
    changelog; an already released version is never overwritten (pull requests
    get a warning when `VERSION` wasn't bumped).
  - Install with `.../releases/latest/download/setup-gamescope-boot.sh`, which
    always points to the newest release.
- `1604ed1` **docs: Versioning and release rules in AGENTS.md**
- `6afef78` **ci: The latest tag follows the newest version tag**
  - When a new version is released, the `latest` tag and release move to it
    (bundle replaced), so the older `.../releases/download/latest/...` URL
    also always gives the newest version.
