# steamify.sh - Steamify CachyOS
#
# Wizard that makes a CachyOS (KDE Plasma) install behave like SteamOS:
# boot into a Steam Deck-style gamescope session, switch to the Plasma
# desktop and back, and reset to gamescope on the next boot/logout.
#
# It opens with a menu that detects which components are on and turns
# them on or off to match what the user picks; turning one off restores
# what was there before (system files from .bak-gamescope-wizard backups,
# KDE settings from the undo journal in lib/state.sh). Components live in
# lib/, see TECHNICAL.md. Safe to re-run.
